-       subtraction
*       multiplication
/       division
%       modulus operator - returns the remainder after division
&&      AND - both operands must be true (has a higher precedence than ||)
||      OR - Only one of the operands need to be true
!       NOT - the opposite
==      equal in value
===     equal in value and type (strict)
!=      not equal
!==     not equal in value and type (strict)
>       greater than
>=      greater than or equal to
